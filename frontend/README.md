# This file contains documentation for the frontend part of the application, including setup instructions and usage.

## Frontend Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

2. **Installation**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Running the Application**: To start the React application, use the following command:

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
